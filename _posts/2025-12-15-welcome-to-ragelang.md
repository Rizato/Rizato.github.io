Welcome to the official Ragelang blog! This is where we'll be documenting our journey building a programming language for the [Langjam Gamejam 2025](https://langjamgamejam.com).

## What is Langjam Gamejam?

Langjam Gamejam is a 7-day hackathon running from December 14–20, 2025. The challenge? Design and implement a programming language, then build a game using it. It's an ambitious goal, but that's what makes it fun!

## What to Expect

Over the next week, we'll be posting updates about:

- **Language Design**: The decisions behind Ragelang's syntax and semantics
- **Implementation**: How we're building the interpreter/compiler
- **The Game**: What we're building with Ragelang
- **Lessons Learned**: What worked, what didn't, and what we'd do differently

## Stay Tuned

Follow along as we build Ragelang from scratch. It's going to be a wild ride!

```
// A taste of what's to come
fn main() {
    print("Let the games begin!")
}
```

Check out the [documentation](/docs/) to learn more about the language, or visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Rizato/ragelang) to see the code.
