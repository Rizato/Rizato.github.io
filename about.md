## What is Ragelang?

Ragelang is a programming language created for the [Langjam Gamejam 2025](https://langjamgamejam.com), a 7-day hackathon where participants design and implement a programming language and then build a game using it.

## The Challenge

The Langjam Gamejam runs from **December 14–20, 2025** and challenges participants to:

- Design and implement a programming language
- Build a game using that language
- Be as creative as possible

## About This Project

This site documents the journey of building Ragelang—from initial design decisions to the final game implementation. Follow along on the [blog](/blog/) for development updates, or dive into the [documentation](/docs/) to learn about the language itself.
